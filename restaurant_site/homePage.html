  <p>Restaurant Description</p>
    <p id = restaurantDesc> Sammy's Classic Restaurant is a fantastic family friendly place. We have great food and
      great service with a killer menu. We opened our doors in the Spring of 2019 and ever since then have been
      a neighborhood favorite. Our chiefs are seasoned vets and have recieved multiple city awards for
      their craftsmenship in the kitchen. Come on down and give us a try and I promise you will become a regular
      here before you know it!
